Python Reference v2.0
# Python Client Library
supabase-pyView on GitHub
This reference documents every object and method available in Supabase's Python library, supabase-py. You can use supabase-py to interact with your Postgres database, listen to database changes, invoke Deno Edge Functions, build login and user management functionality, and manage large files.
## Installing
### Install with PyPi#
You can install supabase-py via the terminal. (for Python > 3.8)
PIPConda
Terminal
`
1
pip install supabase
`
## Initializing
You can initialize a new Supabase client using the `create_client()` method.
The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.
### Parameters
  * supabase_urlRequiredstring
The unique Supabase URL which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.
  * supabase_keyRequiredstring
The unique Supabase Key which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.
  * optionsOptionalClientOptions
Options to change the Auth behaviors.

## Fetch data
  * By default, Supabase projects return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in your project's API settings. It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
  * `select()` can be combined with Filters
  * `select()` can be combined with Modifiers
  * `apikey` is a reserved keyword if you're using the Supabase Platform and should be avoided as a column name.


### Parameters
  * columnsOptionalstring
The columns to retrieve, defaults to `*`.
  * countOptionalCountMethod
The property to use to get the count of rows returned.

### Parameters
  * jsonRequireddict, list
The values to insert. Pass an dict to insert a single row or an list to insert multiple rows.
  * countOptionalCountMethod

Data source
Response
## Delete data
  * `delete()` should always be combined with filters to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
  * If you use `delete()` with filters and you have RLS enabled, only rows visible through `SELECT` policies are deleted. Note that by default no rows are visible, so you need at least one `SELECT`/`ALL` policy that makes the rows visible.
  * When using `delete().in_()`, specify an array of values to target multiple rows with a single query. This is particularly useful for batch deleting entries that share common criteria, such as deleting users by their IDs. Ensure that the array you provide accurately represents all records you intend to delete to avoid unintended data removal.


### Parameters
  * countOptionalCountMethod
The property to use to get the count of rows returned.
  * returningOptionalReturnMethod
Either 'minimal' or 'representation'. Defaults to 'representation'.

## Call a Postgres function
You can call Postgres functions as _Remote Procedure Calls_ , logic in your database that you can execute from anywhere. Functions are useful when the logic rarely changesâ€”like for password resets and updates.
`
1
create or replace function hello_world() returns text as $$
2
 select 'Hello world';
3
$$ language sql;
`
### Parameters
  * fnRequiredcallable
The stored procedure call to be executed.
  * paramsOptionaldict of any
Parameters passed into the stored procedure call.
  * getOptionaldict of any
When set to `true`, `data` will not be returned. Useful if you only need the count.
  * headOptionaldict of any
When set to `true`, the function will be called with read-only access mode.
  * countOptionalCountMethod
Count algorithm to use to count rows returned by the function. Only applicable for set-returning functions. `"exact"`: Exact but slow count algorithm. Performs a `COUNT(*)` under the hood. `"planned"`: Approximated but fast count algorithm. Uses the Postgres statistics under the hood. `"estimated"`: Uses exact count for low numbers and planned count for high numbers.

## Using filters
Filters allow you to only return rows that match certain conditions.
Filters can be used on `select()`, `update()`, `upsert()`, and `delete()` queries.
If a Postgres function returns a table response, you can also apply filters.

## Using modifiers
Filters work on the row levelâ€”they allow you to return rows that only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows. Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definitionâ€”allowing you to change the format of the response (e.g., returning a CSV string).
Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that returns a table response).
## Order the results
Order the query result by `column`.
### Parameters
  * columnRequiredstring
The column to order by
  * descOptionalbool
Whether the rows should be ordered in descending order or not.
  * foreign_tableOptionalstring
Foreign table name whose results are to be ordered.
  * nullsfirstOptionalbool

## Limit the number of rows returned
### Parameters
  * sizeRequirednumber

With `select()`On a foreign table
`
1
response = supabase.table("planets").select("name").limit(1).execute()
`
Data source
Response
## Limit the query to a range
Limit the query result by starting at an offset (`start`) and ending at the offset (`end`). Only records within this range are returned. This respects the query order and if there is no order clause the range could behave unexpectedly.
The `start` and `end` values are 0-based and inclusive: `range(1, 3)` will include the second, third and fourth rows of the query.
### Parameters
  * startRequirednumber
The starting index from which to limit the result.
  * endRequirednumber
The last index to which to limit the result.
  * foreign_tableOptionalstring
Set this to limit rows of foreign tables instead of the parent table.

Notes
## Using explain
For debugging slow queries, you can get the Postgres `EXPLAIN` execution plan of a query using the `explain()` method. This works on any query, even for `rpc()` or writes.
Explain is not enabled by default as it can reveal sensitive information about your database. It's best to only enable this for testing environments but if you wish to enable it for production you can provide additional protection by using a `pre-request` function.
Follow the Performance Debugging Guide to enable the functionality on your project.
### Parameters
  * walOptionalboolean
If `true`, include information on WAL record generation.
  * verboseOptionalboolean
If `true`, the query identifier will be returned and `data` will include the output columns of the query.
  * settingsOptionalboolean
If `true`, include information on configuration parameters that affect query planning.
  * formatOptionalboolean
The format of the output, can be `"text"` (default) or `"json"`.
  * formatOptional"text" | "json"
The format of the output, can be `"text"` (default) or `"json"`.
  * buffersOptionalboolean
If `true`, include information on buffer usage.
  * analyzeOptionalboolean
If `true`, the query will be executed and the actual run time will be returned.

Notes
## Overview
  * The auth methods can be accessed via the `supabase.auth` namespace.
  * By default, the supabase client sets `persist_session` to true and attempts to store the session in memory.
  * Any email links and one-time passwords (OTPs) sent have a default expiry of 24 hours. We have the following rate limits in place to guard against brute force attacks.
  * The expiry of an access token can be set in the "JWT expiry limit" field in your project's auth settings. A refresh token never expires and can only be used once.


## Create a new user
  * By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in your project.
  * **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up. 
    * If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.
    * If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.
  * By default, when the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the `SITE_URL`. You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in your project.
  * If sign_up() is called for an existing confirmed user: 
    * When both **Confirm email** and **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) are enabled in your project, an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
    * When either **Confirm email** or **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.
  * To fetch the currently logged-in user, refer to `get_user()`.


### Parameters

Response
## Sign in a user through OTP
  * Requires either an email or phone number.
  * This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
  * If the user doesn't exist, `sign_in_with_otp()` will signup the user instead. To restrict this behavior, you can set `should_create_user` in `SignInWithPasswordlessCredentials.options` to `false`.
  * If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
  * If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
  * The magic link's destination URL is determined by the `SITE_URL`.
  * See redirect URLs and wildcards to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
  * Magic links and OTPs share the same implementation. To send users a one-time code instead of a magic link, modify the magic link email template to include `{{ .Token }}` instead of `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`.

## Sign in a user through OAuth
  * This method is used for signing in using a third-party provider.
  * Supabase supports many different third-party providers.


### Parameters
  * credentialsRequiredSignInWithOAuthCredentials
Details


Sign in using a third-party providerSign in using a third-party provider with redirectSign in with scopes
`
1
response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_oauth({
2
 "provider": 'github'
3
})
`
## Sign in a user through SSO
  * Before you can call this method you need to establish a connection to an identity provider. Use the CLI commands to do this.
  * If you've associated an email domain to the identity provider, you can use the `domain` property to start a sign-in flow.
  * In case you need to use a different way to start the authentication flow with an identity provider, you can use the `provider_id` property. For example: 
    * Mapping specific user email addresses with an identity provider.
    * Using different hints to identity the identity provider to be used by the user, like a company-specific page, IP address or other tracking information.


### Parameters
  * paramsRequiredSignInWithSSOCredentials
Details


Sign in with email domainSign in with provider UUID
`

 response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_sso({"domain": "company.com"})
`
Response
Notes
## Sign out a user
  * In order to use the `sign_out()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
  * By default, `sign_out()` uses the global scope, which signs out all other sessions that the user is logged into as well.
  * Since Supabase Auth uses JWTs for authentication, the access token JWT will be valid until it's expired. When the user signs out, Supabase revokes the refresh token and deletes the JWT from the client-side. This does not revoke the JWT and it will still be valid until it expires.


### Parameters
  * optionsOptionalSignOutOptions
Details


Sign out
`
1
response = supabase.auth.sign_out()
`
## Send a password reset request
  * The password reset flow consist of 2 broad steps: (i) Allow the user to login via the password reset link; (ii) Update the user's password.
  * The `reset_password_for_email()` only sends a password reset link to the user's email. To update the user's password, see `update_user()`.
  * When the user clicks the reset link in the email they are redirected back to your application. You can configure the URL that the user is redirected to with the `redirectTo` parameter. See redirect URLs and wildcards to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
  * After the user has been redirected successfully, prompt them for a new password and call `update_user()`:


`
1
response = supabase.auth.update_user({
2
 "password": new_password
3
})
`
### Parameters
  * emailRequiredstring
The email address of the user.
  * optionsOptionalobject
Details


Reset password
`
1
supabase.auth.reset_password_for_email(email, {
2
 "redirect_to": "https://example.com/update-password",
3
})
`
## Verify and log in through OTP
  * The `verify_otp` method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be `sms` or `phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following: `email`, `recovery`, `invite` or `email_change` (`signup` and `magiclink` types are deprecated).
  * The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before `verify_otp` to sign up / sign-in a user.
  * The `TokenHash` is contained in the email templates and can be used to sign in. You may wish to use the hash with Magic Links for the PKCE flow for Server Side Auth. See this guide for more details.


### Parameters
  * paramsRequiredVerifyOtpParams
Details


Verify Signup One-Time Password (OTP)Verify SMS One-Time Password (OTP)Verify Email Auth (Token Hash)

`
Response
## Retrieve a session
  * This method retrieves the current local session (i.e in memory).
  * The session contains a signed JWT and unencoded session data.
  * Since the unencoded session data is retrieved from the local storage medium, **do not** rely on it as a source of trusted data on the server. It could be tampered with by the sender. If you need verified, trustworthy user data, call `get_user` instead.
  * If the session has an expired access token, this method will use the refresh token to get a new session.


Get the session data
`
1
response = supabase.auth.get_session()
`
Response
## Retrieve a new session
Returns a new session, regardless of expiry status. Takes in an optional refresh token. If not passed in, then refresh_session() will attempt to retrieve it from get_session(). If the current session's refresh token is invalid, an error will be thrown.
  * This method will refresh the session whether the current one is expired or not.


### Parameters
  * refresh_tokenOptionalstring


Refresh session using the current session
`
1
response = supabase.auth.refresh_session()
`
Response
## Retrieve a user
  * This method fetches the user object from the database instead of local session.
  * This method is useful for checking if the user is authorized because it validates the user's access token JWT on the server.


### Parameters
  * jwtOptionalstring
Takes in an optional access token JWT. If no JWT is provided, the JWT from the current session is used.


Get the logged in user with the current existing sessionGet the logged in user with a custom access token jwt
`
1
response = supabase.auth.get_user()
`
Response
## Update a user
  * In order to use the `update_user()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
  * By default, email updates sends a confirmation link to both the user's current and new email. To only send a confirmation link to the user's new email, disable **Secure email change** in your project's email auth provider settings.


Update the email for an authenticated userUpdate the phone number for an authenticated userUpdate the password for an authenticated userUpdate the user's metadataUpdate the user's password with a nonce
`
1
response = supabase.auth.update_user({
2
 "email": "new@email.com"
3
})
`
Response
Notes
## Retrieve identities linked to a user
Gets all the identities linked to a user.
  * The user needs to be signed in to call `get_user_identities()`.


Returns a list of identities linked to the user
`
1
response = supabase.auth.get_user_identities()
`
Response
## Link an identity to a user
  * The **Enable Manual Linking** option must be enabled from your project's authentication settings.
  * The user needs to be signed in to call `link_identity()`.
  * If the candidate identity is already linked to the existing user or another user, `link_identity()` will fail.
  * If `link_identity` is run on the server, you should handle the redirect.


### Parameters
  * credentialsRequiredSignInWithOAuthCredentials
Details


Link an identity to a user
`
1
response = supabase.auth.link_identity({
2
 provider: 'github'
3
})
`
Response
## Unlink an identity from a user
  * The **Enable Manual Linking** option must be enabled from your project's authentication settings.
  * The user needs to be signed in to call `unlink_identity()`.
  * The user must have at least 2 identities in order to unlink an identity.
  * The identity to be unlinked must belong to the user.


### Parameters
  * identityRequiredUserIdentity
Details


Unlink an identity
`
1
# retrieve all identites linked to a user

7
).pop()
89
# unlink the google identity
10
response = supabase.auth.unlink_identity(google_identity)
`
## Send a password reauthentication nonce
  * This method is used together with `updateUser()` when a user's password needs to be updated.
  * If you require your user to reauthenticate before updating their password, you need to enable the **Secure password change** option in your project's email provider settings.
  * A user is only require to reauthenticate before updating their password if **Secure password change** is enabled and the user **hasn't recently signed in**. A user is deemed recently signed in if the session was created in the last 24 hours.
  * This method will send a nonce to the user's email. If the user doesn't have a confirmed email address, the method will send the nonce to the user's confirmed phone number instead.

Notes
## Resend an OTP
  * Resends a signup confirmation, email change or phone change email to the user.
  * Passwordless sign-ins can be resent by calling the `sign_in_with_otp()` method again.
  * Password recovery emails can be resent by calling the `reset_password_for_email()` method again.
  * This method will only resend an email or phone OTP to the user if there was an initial signup, email change or phone change request being made.
  * You can specify a redirect url when you resend an email link using the `email_redirect_to` option.


### Parameters
  * credentialsRequiredResendCredentials

Notes
## Set the session data
Sets the session data from the current session. If the current session is expired, setSession will take care of refreshing it to obtain a new session. If the refresh token or access token in the current session is invalid, an error will be thrown.
  * This method sets the session using an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.
  * If successful, a `SIGNED_IN` event is emitted.

`
Response
## Auth MFA
This section contains methods commonly used for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and are invoked behind the `supabase.auth.mfa` namespace.
Currently, we only support time-based one-time password (TOTP) as the 2nd factor. We don't support recovery codes but we allow users to enroll more than 1 TOTP factor, with an upper limit of 10.
Having a 2nd TOTP factor for recovery frees the user of the burden of having to store their recovery codes somewhere. It also reduces the attack surface since multiple recovery codes are usually generated compared to just having 1 backup TOTP factor.
## Enroll a factor
  * Currently, `totp` is the only supported `factor_type`. The returned `id` should be used to create a challenge.
  * To create a challenge, see `mfa.challenge()`.
  * To verify a challenge, see `mfa.verify()`.
  * To create and verify a challenge in a single step, see `mfa.challenge_and_verify()`.

`
## Get Authenticator Assurance Level
  * Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) is the measure of the strength of an authentication mechanism.
  * In Supabase, having an AAL of `aal1` refers to having the 1st factor of authentication such as an email and password or OAuth sign-in while `aal2` refers to the 2nd factor of authentication such as a time-based, one-time-password (TOTP).
  * If the user has a verified factor, the `next_level` field will return `aal2`, else, it will return `aal1`.


Get the AAL details of a session
`

res = supabase.auth.mfa.get_authenticator_assurance_level()
`
## Auth Admin
  * Any method under the `supabase.auth.admin` namespace requires a `service_role` key.
  * These methods are considered admin methods and should be called on a trusted server. Never expose your `service_role` key in the browser.

## Retrieve a user
  * Fetches the user object from the database based on the user's id.
  * The `get_user_by_id()` method requires the user's id which maps to the `auth.users.id` column.


### Parameters
  * uidRequiredstring
The user's unique identifier
This function should only be called on a server. Never expose your `service_role` key in the browser.


Fetch the user object using the access_token jwt
`

response = supabase.auth.admin.list_users()
`
## Create a user
  * To confirm the user's email address or phone number, set `email_confirm` or `phone_confirm` to true. Both arguments default to false.
  * `create_user()` will not send a confirmation email to the user. You can use `invite_user_by_email()` if you want to send them an email invite instead.
  * If you are sure that the created user's email or phone number is legitimate and verified, you can set the `email_confirm` or `phone_confirm` param to `true`.


### Parameters
  * attributesRequiredAdminUserAttributes
Details


With custom user metadataAuto-confirm the user's emailAuto-confirm the user's phone number

Response
## Delete a user
Delete a user. Requires a `service_role` key.
  * The `delete_user()` method requires the user's ID, which maps to the `auth.users.id` column.


### Parameters
  * idRequiredstring
The user id you want to remove.
  * should_soft_deleteOptionalboolean
If true, then the user will be soft-deleted (setting `deleted_at` to the current timestamp and disabling their account while preserving their data) from the auth schema. Defaults to false for backward compatibility.
This function should only be called on a server. Never expose your `service_role` key in the browser.

## Send an email invite link
Sends an invite link to an email address.
  * Sends an invite link to the user's email address.
  * The `invite_user_by_email()` method is typically used by administrators to invite users to join the application.
  * Note that PKCE is not supported when using `invite_user_by_email`. This is because the browser initiating the invite is often different from the browser accepting the invite which makes it difficult to provide the security guarantees required of the PKCE flow.


### Parameters
  * emailRequiredstring
The email address of the user.
  * optionsOptionalInviteUserByEmailOptions
Details


Invite a user
`

## Invokes a Supabase Edge Function.
Invoke a Supabase Function.
  * Requires an Authorization header.
  * When you pass in a body to your function, we automatically attach the Content-Type header for `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, `File`, `FormData` and `String`. If it doesn't match any of these types we assume the payload is `json`, serialise it and attach the `Content-Type` header as `application/json`. You can override this behaviour by passing in a `Content-Type` header of your own.

## Subscribe to channel
  * By default, Broadcast and Presence are enabled for all projects.
  * By default, listening to database changes is disabled for new projects due to database performance and security concerns. You can turn it on by managing Realtime's replication.
  * You can receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes by setting the table's `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` (e.g., `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`).
  * Row level security is not applied to delete statements. When RLS is enabled and replica identity is set to full, only the primary key is sent to clients.
