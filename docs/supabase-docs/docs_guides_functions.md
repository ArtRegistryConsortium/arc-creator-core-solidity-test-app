Edge Functions
Edge Functions
Globally distributed TypeScript functions.
Edge Functions are server-side TypeScript functions, distributed globally at the edgeâ€”close to your users. They can be used for listening to webhooks or integrating your Supabase project with third-parties like Stripe. Edge Functions are developed using Deno, which offers a few benefits to you as a developer:
  * It is open source.
  * It is portable. Supabase Edge Functions run locally, and on any other Deno-compatible platform (including self-hosted infrastructure).
  * It is TypeScript first and supports WASM.
  * Edge Functions are globally distributed for low-latency.
