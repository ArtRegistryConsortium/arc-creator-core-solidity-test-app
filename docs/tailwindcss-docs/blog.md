Tailwind CSS v3.1: You wanna get nuts? Come on, let's get nuts!
It's been about six months since we released Tailwind CSS v3.0, and even though we've been collecting a lot of little improvements in the codebase since then, we just didn't have _that-one-feature_ yet that makes you say _"okay, it's release-cuttin' time"_.

It's been a while since I've written about what we've been working on so I have a lot to share!

So put your swim suit on, sit back in your lounge chair, and prepare to soak up some vitamin CSS.

Just-In-Time: The Next Generation of Tailwind CSS
One of the hardest constraints we've had to deal with as we've improved Tailwind CSS over the years is the generated file size in development. With enough customizations to your config file, the generated CSS can reach 10mb or more, and there's only so much CSS that build tools and even the browser itself will comfortably tolerate.

Multi-line truncation with @tailwindcss/line-clamp
Imagine you're implementing a beautiful design you or someone on your team carefully crafted in Figma. You've nailed all the different layouts at each breakpoint, perfected the whitespace and typography, and the photography you're using is really bringing the design to life.It looks totally amazing — until you connect it your actual production content and realize that your beautiful grid of blog cards falls apart because, of course, _real_ article excerpts aren't all magically exactly three lines long, and now each card is a different height.Sound familiar? If so, the line-clamp plugin is here to save your bacon.
