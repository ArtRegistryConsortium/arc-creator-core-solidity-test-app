Utilities for controlling the alignment of text.
Class| Styles  
---|---  
`text-left`| `text-align: left;`  
`text-center`| `text-align: center;`  
`text-right`| `text-align: right;`

`text-start`| `text-align: start;`  
`text-end`| `text-align: end;`  
## Examples
### Left aligning text
Use the `text-left` utility to left align the text of an element:
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I _was_ a marine biologist.
```
<p class="text-left">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

### Right aligning text
Use the `text-right` utility to right align the text of an element:
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I _was_ a marine biologist.
```
<p class="text-right">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

### Centering text
Use the `text-center` utility to center the text of an element:
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I _was_ a marine biologist.
```
<p class="text-center">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

### Justifying text
Use the `text-justify` utility to justify the text of an element:
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I _was_ a marine biologist.
```
<p class="text-justify">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

### Responsive design
Prefix a `text-align` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
```
<p class="text-left md:text-center ..."> <!-- ... --></p>
```

Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
