# text-decoration-style
Utilities for controlling the style of text decorations.
Class| Styles  
---|---  
`decoration-solid`| `text-decoration-style: solid;`  
`decoration-double`| `text-decoration-style: double;`  
`decoration-dotted`| `text-decoration-style: dotted;`  
`decoration-dashed`| `text-decoration-style: dashed;`  
`decoration-wavy`| `text-decoration-style: wavy;`  
## Examples
### Basic example
Use utilities like `decoration-dotted` and `decoration-dashed` to change the text decoration style of an element:
decoration-solid
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
decoration-double
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
decoration-dotted
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
decoration-dashed
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
decoration-wavy
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
```
<p class="underline decoration-solid">The quick brown fox...</p><p class="underline decoration-double">The quick brown fox...</p><p class="underline decoration-dotted">The quick brown fox...</p><p class="underline decoration-dashed">The quick brown fox...</p><p class="underline decoration-wavy">The quick brown fox...</p>
```

### Responsive design
Prefix a `text-decoration-style` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
```
<p class="underline md:decoration-dashed ..."> <!-- ... --></p>
```

Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
