# Routing Fundamentals
### Layouts and Templates
Create your first shared layout in Next.js.
### Linking and Navigating
Learn how navigation works in Next.js, and how to use the Link Component and `useRouter` hook.
### Error Handling
Learn how to display expected errors and handle uncaught exceptions.
### Loading UI and Streaming
Built on top of Suspense, Loading UI allows you to create a fallback for specific route segments, and automatically stream content as it becomes ready.
### Redirecting
Learn the different ways to handle redirects in Next.js.
### Route Groups
Route Groups can be used to partition your Next.js application into different sections.
### Dynamic Routes
Dynamic Routes can be used to programmatically generate route segments from dynamic data.
### Parallel Routes
Simultaneously render one or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. A pattern for highly dynamic applications.
### Intercepting Routes
Use intercepting routes to load a new route within the current layout while masking the browser URL, useful for advanced routing patterns such as modals.
### Route Handlers
Create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web's Request and Response APIs.
### Middleware
Learn how to use Middleware to run code before a request is completed.
### Internationalization
Add support for multiple languages with internationalized routing and localized content.
