# Styling
Next.js supports different ways of styling your application, including:
  * **CSS Modules** : Create locally scoped CSS classes to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.
  * **Global CSS** : Simple to use and familiar for those experienced with traditional CSS, but can lead to larger CSS bundles and difficulty managing styles as the application grows.
  * **Tailwind CSS** : A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid custom designs by composing utility classes.
  * **Sass** : A popular CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
  * **CSS-in-JS** : Embed CSS directly in your JavaScript components, enabling dynamic and scoped styling.
