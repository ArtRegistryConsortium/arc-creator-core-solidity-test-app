For this course, we'll build a financial dashboard that has:
  * A public home page.
  * A login page.
  * Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
  * The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.


The dashboard will also have an accompanying database, which you'll set up in a later chapter.
By the end of the course, you'll have the essential skills needed to start building full-stack Next.js applications.
## Overview
Here's an overview of features you'll learn about in this course:
  * **Styling** : The different ways to style your application in Next.js.
  * **Optimizations** : How to optimize images, links, and fonts.
  * **Routing** : How to create nested layouts and pages using file-system routing.
  * **Data Fetching** : How to set up a Postgres database on Vercel, and best practices for fetching and streaming.
