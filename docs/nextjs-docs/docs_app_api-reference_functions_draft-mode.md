# draftMode
`draftMode` is an **async** function allows you to enable and disable Draft Mode, as well as check if Draft Mode is enabled in a Server Component.
app/page.ts
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import { draftMode } from'next/headers'
exportdefaultasyncfunctionPage() {
const { isEnabled } =awaitdraftMode()
}
```

## Reference
The following methods and properties are available:
Method| Description  
---|---  
`isEnabled`| A boolean value that indicates if Draft Mode is enabled.  
`enable()`| Enables Draft Mode in a Route Handler by setting a cookie (`__prerender_bypass`).  
`disable()`| Disables Draft Mode in a Route Handler by deleting a cookie.  
## Good to know
  * `draftMode` is an **asynchronous** function that returns a promise. You must use `async/await` or React's `use` function. 
    * In version 14 and earlier, `draftMode` was a synchronous function. To help with backwards compatibility, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be deprecated in the future.
  * A new bypass cookie value will be generated each time you run `next build`. This ensures that the bypass cookie canâ€™t be guessed.
  * To test Draft Mode locally over HTTP, your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.


## Examples
### Enabling Draft Mode
To enable Draft Mode, create a new Route Handler and call the `enable()` method:
app/draft/route.ts
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import { draftMode } from'next/headers'
exportasyncfunctionGET(request:Request) {
constdraft=awaitdraftMode()
draft.enable()
returnnewResponse('Draft mode is enabled')
}
```

### Disabling Draft Mode
By default, the Draft Mode session ends when the browser is closed.
To disable Draft Mode manually, call the `disable()` method in your Route Handler:
app/draft/route.ts
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import { draftMode } from'next/headers'
exportasyncfunctionGET(request:Request) {
constdraft=awaitdraftMode()
draft.disable()
returnnewResponse('Draft mode is disabled')
}
```

Then, send a request to invoke the Route Handler. If calling the route using the `<Link>` component, you must pass `prefetch={false}` to prevent accidentally deleting the cookie on prefetch.
### Checking if Draft Mode is enabled
You can check if Draft Mode is enabled in a Server Component with the `isEnabled` property:
app/page.ts
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import { draftMode } from'next/headers'
exportdefaultasyncfunctionPage() {
const { isEnabled } =awaitdraftMode()
return (
  <main>
   <h1>My Blog Post</h1>
   <p>Draft Mode is currently {isEnabled ?'Enabled':'Disabled'}</p>
  </main>
 )
}
```
